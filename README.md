# Virtual Pet üê∂

The next track of Manchester Codes Software Engineer FastTrack course is to make a virtual pet! A lot like a Tamagotchi from when I was a kid my pet will have a name, I can feed, talk to them and increase their fitness and lastly they will die after they reach a certain age or I neglect them!

## Languages written in

My virtual pet will predominantly be written in JavaScript with some HTML & CSS also. 

## Installation

Fork & clone the repo (please use SSH Key):

```
$ git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/virtual-pet.git
```

Add an upstream to make siure you can pull any changes I make:

```
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:jbram-js/virtual-pet.git
```
Install npm within the Virtual Pet directory:

```bash
$ npm install
```

I will be practicing Test Driven Development (TDD) for this track so you will also need to install Jest to the directory:

```bash 
$ npm install -D jest
```

## Running tests

Once you have completed the above steps, to run a test ensure you are in the correct directory and run the below command:

```bash
$ npm test
```

## Contributing
Contribution to the Virtual Pet repo is encouraged. 

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
